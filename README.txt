# Heart Disease Prediction using Optimization Algorithms

# Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this code:
pandas
scikit-learn
tensorflow
mlrose_hiive
numpy

# Running the code
Install the required libraries by running pip install pandas scikit-learn tensorflow mlrose-hiive numpy.
Download the heart_cleveland_upload.csv dataset and place it in the same directory as the code file.
Open the code file and run it in a Python environment.
The code will preprocess the data by scaling the numerical features and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
The code will define the fitness function for optimizing the weights of the neural network model.
The code will define the optimization problems for each of the four algorithms.
The code will run each of the four algorithms and output the best solution found and the corresponding fitness value.
